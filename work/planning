- different status, keep data in the linked list of chars;
- get it to the main;
- identificator for each node in order to do something later with it;
- function to print this shit;
- create an adjacency list;
- we can split a line into parts for validation analysis;
- strequal for the command analysis;


- breadth first search for all vertices (do not stop it in the end)
- find all path while breadth first search(search pointer from the room from which iÂ§ve came -> adding to the queque)
