- breadth - first search;
- find the shortest way (from the start or from special point);
- best ways to go through the linked list and the queque (maybe some sort of the search algorithm)
- â€‹Hash table for lem1
- i don`t need to keep the quantity of ants in the each specific node;
- adjustment matrix;
- bool for the ant detection in a room;
calculate from the end;
- file / output;
- bool 0 1;
- is nbr;
- get the parsing done;

- how to store the highths and links;
- how to analyze them;
